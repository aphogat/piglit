/**
 * \file draw-buffers-alpha-to-one.cpp
 *
 * Verify sample alpha to one with multiple draw buffers
 *
 * When rendering to multiple draw buffers, GL_SAMPLE_ALPHA_TO_ONE should
 * modify the alpha values sent to each draw buffer. OpenGL 3.3 specification's
 * section 4.1.3 (page 196 of pdf) is little unclear about the exact behavior
 * in above mentioned case:
 *
 * "All alpha values in this section refer only to the alpha component of the
 * fragment shader output linked to color number zero, index zero (see section
 * 3.9.2) if a fragment shader is in use, or the alpha component of the result
 * of fixed-function fragment shading. If the fragment shader does not write to
 * this output, the alpha value is undefined."
 *
 * And later in the same section it is stated that:
 *
 * "Next, if SAMPLE_ALPHA_TO_ONE is enabled, each alpha value is replaced by
 * the maximum representable alpha value for fixed-point color buffers, or by
 * 1.0 for floating-point buffers. Otherwise, the alpha values are not changed."
 *
 * By reading above two references together, specification seems to suggest that
 * alpha values for only draw buffer zero will be modified when GL_SAMPLE_TO_ONE.
 * is enabled. But with NVIDIA's proprietary drivers this test verifies that
 * alpha values for all the draw buffers will be modified. In my opinion, this
 * section needs clarification from khronos.
 *
 * At present test is based on the behavior observed with NVIDIA's proprietary
 * drivers.
 *
 * This test operates by drawing a pattern in multisample FBO to generate
 * reference and test images for all the draw buffers. Reference images are drawn
 * to right half of window system draw buffer and test images to left half.
 *
 * Compare the left and right halves of window system frame buffer to verify
 * the test image.
