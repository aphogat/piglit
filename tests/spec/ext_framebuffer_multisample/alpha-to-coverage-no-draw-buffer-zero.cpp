/**
 * \file alpha-to-coverage-no-draw-buffer-zero.cpp
 *
 * Verify sample alpha to coverage with multiple draw buffers when nothing
 * is bound to draw buffer zero.
 *
 * When nothing is bound to draw buffer zero, GL_SAMPLE_ALPHA_TO_COVERAGE
 * still needs to work properly for rest of the draw buffers. The alpha value
 * used to determine coverage should come from draw buffer zero.
 *
 * This test operates by drawing a pattern in multisample FBO to generate
 * reference and test images for all the draw buffers. Reference images are
 * drawn to right half of window system draw buffer and test images to left
 * half.
 *
 * Compute the expected color values for all the draw buffers.
 *
 * Probe all the draw buffers blitted to downsampled FBO (resolve_fbo) and
 * compare against expected color values.
